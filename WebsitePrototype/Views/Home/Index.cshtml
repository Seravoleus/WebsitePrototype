                <h4>AGS2 - What it is and how it will affect you</h4>
                <p style="color: #fff;">
                    The way you submit your import (& export) declarations to Customs is changing. The old Sagitta Invoer system is in the process of being phased out and replaced by AGS2 (Aangiftesysteem - Phase 2). In a nutshell, this means that you will need to replace or upgrade your current software package.

                    But don’t panic, help is at hand. At Langdon Systems we are experts when it comes to Customs legislation and procedures. We’ll give you the facts about AGS, how it’s going to impact on your current work processes and what you need to do.
